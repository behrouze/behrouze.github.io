Typi‐\ncally, rsync is configured to use ssh by default, but you may prefer to use rsh on a local network.</p>\n<p>--archive, -a\nThis is equivalent to <code class=\"language-text\">-rlptgoD</code>.<br>\nIt is a quick way of saying you want <strong>recursion</strong> and want to <strong>preserve almost everything</strong>.<br>\nBe aware that it does not include preserving ACLs (-A), xattrs (-X), atimes (-U), crtimes (-N), nor the finding and preserving of hardlinks (-H).</p>\n<p>--dry-run, -n\nThis  makes  rsync perform a trial run that doesn't make any changes (and produces mostly the same output as a real run).  It is most commonly used in\ncombination with the --verbose, -v and/or --itemize-changes, -i options to see what an rsync command is going to do before one actually runs it.</p>\n<p>--compress, -z\nWith this option, rsync compresses the file data as it is sent to the destination machine, which reduces the amount of data being transmitted -- some‐\nthing that is useful over a slow connection.</p>\n<p>--cvs-exclude, -C\nThis is a useful shorthand for excluding a broad range of files that you often don't want to transfer between systems.  It uses a similar algorithm to\nCVS to determine if a file should be ignored.\nThe exclude list is initialized to exclude the following items (these initial items are marked as perishable -- see the FILTER RULES section):\nRCS SCCS CVS CVS.adm RCSLOG cvslog.*  tags TAGS .make.state .nse_depinfo <em>~ #</em> .#* ,* _$* *$ *.old *.bak *.BAK *.orig <em>.rej .del-</em> *.a  *.olb  *.o\n*.obj *.so *.exe *.Z *.elc *.ln core .svn/ .git/ .hg/ .bzr/\nthen, files listed in a $HOME/.cvsignore are added to the list and any files listed in the CVSIGNORE environment variable (all cvsignore names are de‐\nlimited by whitespace).\nFinally, any file is ignored if it is in the same directory as a .cvsignore file and matches one of the patterns listed therein.  Unlike rsync's  fil‐\nter/exclude files, these patterns are split on whitespace.  See the cvs(1) manual for more information.</p>\n<p>--chown=USER:GROUP\nThis option forces all files to be owned by USER with group GROUP.  This is a simpler interface than using --usermap and --groupmap directly,  but  it\nis  implemented  using  those options internally, so you cannot mix them.  If either the USER or GROUP is empty, no mapping for the omitted user/group\nwill occur.  If GROUP is empty, the trailing colon may be omitted, but if USER is empty, a leading colon must be supplied.</p>\n<p>Pour les connexions qui sont par défaut faites par #ssh, configurer les options du client via le fichier <code class=\"language-text\">.ssh/config</code></p>"}},
